/// @section Introduction
///
/// This is a library implementing some neighborhood based
/// metaheuristics with or without memory.
///
/// The solution instance must implement mets::feasible_solution and
/// the moves must be derived from mets::move classes.
///
/// The neighborhood can be specified implementing a
/// mets::move_manager subclass or providing another class with the
/// same concept (using the move_manager can ease things, but you can
/// also provide your own custom neighorhood iterator).
///
/// All the mentioned classes must be implemented to model the problem
/// at hand.  See as an example the "tutorial" and "qap" programs.
///
/// You are also responsible of configuring and running the algorithm
/// of choice.
///
/// Once your model is set up you are free of experimenting different
/// metaheuristics without changing it, but simply configuring one
/// algorithm or another.
///
/// Each algorithm can be customized implementing your own decorating
/// classes, although a bunch of predefined and commonly used
/// decorators are provided with the library, some problems may need
/// customary tabu lists, termination criterias, aspiration criteria,
/// or cooling schedules.
///
/// The framework you must implement your model into is made of:
///
/// - mets::feasible_solution
///   - mets::evaluable_solution (use this if you also use mets::best_ever_solution)
///   - mets::permutation_problem
/// - mets::move
///   - mets::mana_move (use this if you also use by mets::simple_tabu_list)
///   - mets::swap_elements
///
/// The toolkit of implemented algorithms is made of:
///
/// - mets::move_manager (or a class implementing the same concept)
///   - mets::swap_neighborhood
/// - mets::local_search
/// - mets::simulated_annealing
///   - mets::abstract_cooling_schedule
///   - mets::solution_recorder
///     - mets::best_ever_solution
///   - mets::termination_criteria_chain
///     - mets::iteration_termination_criteria
///     - mets::noimprove_termination_criteria
///     - mets::threshold_termination_criteria
/// - mets::tabu_search
///   - mets::tabu_list_chain
///     - mets::simple_tabu_list
///   - mets::aspiration_criteria_chain
///     - mets::best_ever_criteria
///   - mets::solution_recorder
///     - mets::best_ever_solution
///   - mets::termination_criteria_chain
///     - mets::iteration_termination_criteria
///     - mets::noimprove_termination_criteria
///     - mets::threshold_termination_criteria
///
/// To use the mets::simple_tabu_list you need to derive your moves
/// from the mets::mana_move base class and implement the pure virtual
/// methods.
